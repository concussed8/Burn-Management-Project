CSS/JS Versioning
To ensure users always receive the latest updates, CSS and JS files include a version query string (?v=n). Update the version number (n) whenever changes are made to force the browser to fetch the latest file.

Guidelines for Choosing Version Numbers
Start Simple: Begin with ?v=1.
Increment for Changes: Each time you make a change to the CSS file that you want users to see immediately, increment the version number. For example:
First update: ?v=2
Second update: ?v=3

Major vs. Minor Changes (Optional):
If you prefer a more structured system, you can use a semantic versioning style, such as ?v=1.0.0:
Increment the first digit for major changes (e.g., redesigns).
Increment the second digit for minor updates.
Increment the third digit for small fixes.

Example Update Process
-You edit the summary_thermal.css file.
-Update your HTML link to include a new version number:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://concussed8.github.io/Burn-Management-Project/styles/summary_thermal.css?v=2">

-Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
-When users load your page, their browser fetches the updated file because the v=2 query tells it the file has changed.

Keeping Track
-Use a simple change log in your project to track what version corresponds to what changes. Example:

summary_thermal.css:
- v=1: Initial release
- v=2: Fixed font sizes and margins
- v=3: Added new colors for headers
This ensures you wonâ€™t accidentally reuse the same version number.
